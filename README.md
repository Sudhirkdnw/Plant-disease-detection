# 🌿 Plant Disease Recognition System

A web-based application built with Streamlit that uses a trained deep learning model to detect plant diseases from images.

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts plant diseases from images using a trained TensorFlow model.
- User-friendly interface with three main sections:
  - **Home**: Introduction and usage guide.
  - **About**: Information about the dataset.
  - **Disease Recognition**: Upload image and detect disease.
- Fast and accurate predictions with a visual interface.

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/plant-disease-recognition.git
   cd plant-disease-recognition


## 📚 Dataset Info
- Data Set Link :- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset
- The dataset consists of 87,000+ RGB images of crop leaves (healthy and    diseased), categorized into 38 classes.

- Split: 80% training (70295), 20% validation (17572), and a separate test set (33 images).

## 🧠 Model
- The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras.
- It expects images of size 128x128 as input.
- Outputs a class prediction index that maps to 1 of 38 plant disease labels.


## 📝 Labels
A few sample classes:

Apple___Apple_scab
Grape___Black_rot
Tomato___Late_blight
Corn_(maize)___Common_rust
... and more (total 38)
